# Python Challenges
1)Pybank:I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. 
2)PyPoll:In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 
3)PyBoss:A company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.
Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format.See both CSV files. 
4)PyParagraph:As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.
